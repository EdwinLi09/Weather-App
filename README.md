The whole purpose of this project is essentially creating my own weather app that presents each city's real-time data, including the temperature, humidity, and wind speed. 
Based on user input, it will automatically generate real time data based on the city that was looked up 
Some of the coding languages I used were: 
1. CSS/HTML
2. JavaScript
