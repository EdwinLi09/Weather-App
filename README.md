The goal of this project is to create a custom weather app that displays real-time data for any city, including temperature, humidity, and wind speed. The app automatically generates this data based on user input. Through this personal project, I gained experience with new coding languages in Visual Studio Code, including: 
1. CSS/HTML
2. JavaScript


# Start-up 

1. Run the code in Visual Studio Code.
2. Ensure the live server is up and running.
3. Once live, it will take you to the browser with the weather application.
4. Enter any city, and the weather data will appear.
