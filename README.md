The goal of this project is to create a custom weather app that displays real-time data for any city, including temperature, humidity, and wind speed. The app automatically generates this data based on user input. Through this personal project, I gained experience with new coding languages in Visual Studio Code, including: 
1. CSS/HTML
2. JavaScript
